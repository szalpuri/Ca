						<p>People in Canada send Christmas Cards to their friends and family.</p> <p>Many Canadians open their gifts on Christmas Eve. Some only open their stocking on Christmas Eve. Others choose one gift to open, then save the rest until Christmas Day.</p> <p>Canadians like to decorate their houses with Christmas Trees, lights and other decorations. There's often Christmas stockings hung by the fireplace, ready for Santa!</p> <p>The main Christmas meal is often roast turkey with vegetables and 'all the trimmings' like mashed potatoes and vegetables. Traditional favorite Christmas desserts include Christmas/plum puddings and mincemeat tarts. Christmas crackers are popular with many people in Canada as well. A rich fruit Christmas Cake is also normally eaten around Christmas time!</p> <p>However, people from different backgrounds and cultures have their own favorite foods at Christmas.</p> <p>Going skiing, skating and tobogganing are also popular if there's snow at Christmas!</p> <p>Canadian children also believe in Santa Claus. Canadians are especially proud to say that their country is the home of Santa Claus. (Although I'm sure the people in Finland would disagree!)</p> <p>The Santa Claus Parade in Toronto is one of the oldest and largest Santa parades in the world! It started in 1913 when Santa was pulled through the streets of Toronto. Children along the route followed Santa and marched along with him. It's been taking place for over 100 years and now is a huge event with over 25 animated floats and 2000 people taking part! It's broadcast on TV around the world.</p><p> Going Mummering is a fun Christmas season activity for adults. Mummers usually come out between December 26th and January 6th (The 12 Days of Christmas).</p>
