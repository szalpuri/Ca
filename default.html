					<p>Spring in Canada arrives in late March, and lasts through April, May and early June in this country.It is a great time to enjoy the area beauty spots, when tourist attractions are quieter and you can spend time outdoors enjoying the longer days and mild weather. During early spring in Ontario, this area becomes busy with the activity of gathering sap to make Maple Syrup.</p>
					<p>With Southern Ontario’s many green spaces and parks, spring is particularly attractive when trees and spring flowers are in bloom.</p>

					<p><b>Daffodils - springtime beauty - jonquilles</b><br>If you have chance, try to take a drive through the countryside when the fruit trees are blossoming, usually in late April or early May. Particularly beautiful in spring in Canada are the orchards of apple trees where the blossoming trees look lovely, row after row - Mother Nature showing her stuff! It is a wonderful sight to see the various colours of blossoms on the different types of trees at this time of year. Cherry, apple, peach, apricot, nectarine and pear trees - all are flowering now and are so beautiful to behold.</p>
					<p>Birds arrive for Spring in Canada. This is the time of year when the Robins, Killdeer , Red Winged Blackbirds, the lovely Hummingbirds , the majestic Tundra Swans, Baltimore Orioles and many other birds, return to this area to breed. From around mid-March and for two or three weeks afterward, the Tundra Swans migrate through this area. Having wintered on the Atlantic coast, in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, these beautiful birds rest at several places in this area as they head for their breeding grounds in the Arctic and Alaska. On the second week-end in May, Canadians celebrate Mother's Day as a special day to remember and treasure Mothers, past and present.</p>
					<p>In May, Canadians celebrate Victoria Day, which is on the Monday prior to May 25th, with a long-weekend as that Monday is officially a day off work for most people.</p>
					<p>Known as the "May 2-4 Week End" it is the end of spring in Canada and is the start of the summer season here.Many people use this long weekend to open up their cabins and cottages, or to spend time in their gardens planting their vegetables and annuals.</p>

					<p>Summer in Canada ..... at least in Southern Ontario, is often hot with very little rain, but sometimes we experience days of high humidity, especially if you are close to any of the Great Lakes. Although many people know that Canada has really cold, snowy winters, many do not realize that we also enjoy long hot summers too!</p>
					<p>The climate here means that Canadians and holidaymakers can enjoy all that Canada has to offer including Summer Festivals and Fairs, wonderful beaches, cottage holidays and much, much more!</p>
					<p><b>Summer beach at Lake Erie</b><br>The average high temperature is usually in the low to mid 20’s Celsius (70s Fahrenheit) and this temperature is perfect for enjoying the many outdoor activities that this area has to offer.</p>
					<p>In Summer-time, camping, fishing and Hiking are popular activities for families and also for those who like solitary pastimes. During the summer months, Canada does not receive very much rain, although we do experience occasional thunder storms, but occasionally we do have several weeks without any measurable rain.This effects the local farmers, as this is a major agricultural area of the country.</p>
					<p>During June the average temperature recorded at the London Airport is a comfortable 23.8ºC, with a typically low temperature of 12ºC. A sizzling high temperature of 38.2ºC was reached on June 11, 1972. In July the temperature in this area typically reaches 26.3ºC with an average minimum temperature of around 14.6ºC degrees. During the month of August, 25.2ºC is the average high temperature with 13.7ºC being the average low daily temperature.</p>
					<p>So you can see that summer in Ontario can be perfect for enjoying so many outdoor activities - fishing, sailing, camping, Hiking and picnicking in the park.</p>

					<p>Fall in Canada is a glorious season: there’s the crisp air, the golden leaves, the awesome surfing. Wait…what? Yes, autumn is a fantastic time to be Canadian, and probably for more reasons than you even realize.</p>
					<p>This area is renowned for the beautiful fall colours that are usually at their peak in the late September and the first half of October. The shades of red, gold and yellow are breath-taking and have to be seen to be believed.</p>
					<p>In fall, the air is crisp and fresh with the promise of winter, and yet the warm sunshine keeps daytime temperatures mild. How long fall lasts and the intensity of the fall colours, depends a great deal upon the temperatures and amount of rain we receive.</p>
					<p>Canada is famous for being the "Land of the Maple Leaf" and this leaf is in the middle of our country's flag.Canada has many Maple trees and the area of Southern Ontario has a breathtaking array of them.There are Red Maples, Sugar Maples, Japanese and Harlequin Maples - you name the Maple and you will find it here! They are lovely trees in any season, but in fall in Ontario they really show their colours. Ontario fall Starting around late September, as the nights grow longer and cooler, the trees begin to change colour. Slowly at first, but here and there, there is a hint of red, yellow or orange amid the green leaves. Slowly but surely, the colours deepen and begin to change, subtly at first, but the trees do change day by day, until they are a riot of flamboyant, extravagant colours! In fall the days remain warm, but the evenings begin to get cooler and with each day that passes, dusk arrives sooner.</p>
					<p>Fall in Ontario is also the time of year when we harvest all the Autumn fruits and vegetables. Pumpkins and Winter Squash ripen now and there are many varieties from which to choose. There are ordinary, orange pumpkins which are great for carving to decorate your home in Autumn."Pie Pumpkins" are smaller and are sweet and ideal for pumpkin pies. There are also huge, oversized, novelty pumpkins such as this one here, which sometimes weigh hundreds of pounds.</p>
					<p>This is also the time of year when our children celebrate Halloween on October 31st.Fall is also the time when apples are harvested in this area. Many delicious varieties of apples, pears and grapes are grown here in Southern Ontario. There are many orchards that are "U-Pick" where you can pick your own fruit during fall in Ontario. Of course Ontario Apples may be purchased at grocery stores and supermarkets everywhere. The apples are wonderful, crisp and fresh, and taste their best when they are fresh from the tree, and make delicious pies and desserts.</p>

					<p>Winter generally starts here in late November and can run through to mid to late-March or even early April. Winter here is cold by many standards, but it is not often that it snows for very long and it's still possible to have periods during the winter months when there is little or no snow on the ground.</p>
					<p>If you are spending time in Canada during the winter, don’t forget to bring your sunglasses as we have brilliant, sunny days!</p>
					<p>The average winter temperature here ranges from about -20 Celsius to -1 Celsius although, at times it can be colder, however, during the winter months we do have periods when the weather is kind and the temperature is considerably warmer than that.</p>
					<p>If you are visiting Canada in winter-time it is best to be prepared for changes in temperature by bringing clothes that enable you to dress in layers.This way you will be able to enjoy the outdoor activities that this area has to offer.For those adventurous souls who want to try some of our winter activities, you can ski, snow-shoe, ice skate and Snowmobile in Canada. Canadians enjoy the outdoors in winter time, so get your woolies and toboggan out and head for the snow-hills! </p>
					<p>In December, snow that falls has a better chance of staying for longer, and this is the time when we replace the summer tires on our cars for winter tires! Driving in winter in Canada can be a challenge, and extra caution is necessary, especially when driving in the first snow-storm of the season, when many motorists appear to have forgotten how to drive in snowy conditions. Snow that falls around Christmas time has a good chance of sticking around for a while, as once the New Year arrives, we can get some really cold weather!</p>
					<p>Skiing is a great way for families or individuals to spend time out-doors in the winter. The London Ski Club is located in the Byron area (south west London) and is a great place to learn to ski and for those with experience too.</p>
					<p><b>Christmas in Canada</b><br>During the season of Christmas in Canada many families take the time to choose their Christmas tree, the tradition of which was brought to Canada in the mid-1800's by settlers who came from Germany, who also brought with them their traditional Advent Wreaths, Ginger-bread Houses and Christmas Cookies. For a more traditional Christmas in Canada you really should experience the full Christmas tree Experience! All around the province there are Christmas Tree farms where you are able to go and select your own tree, which then is chopped down, either by you or by the staff, loaded onto the roof of your car, or in the back of a pick-up truck, and away you go - ready to take that perfect Christmas Tree home, to be decorated by your family.</p>
